      <h3>How It All Began</h3>
      <p>The laughs, the eye contact, the spark… it all felt like destiny whispering “this is the one.”
      Our story began in the sky — literally. A flight from Bangalore to Pune, two strangers sitting under the same clouds, unaware that destiny was smiling at them. ☁
A simple conversation turned into comfort.
Our first date at Irani Café had its own magic — chai, awkward smiles, long eye contact, and the beginning of something beautiful.
Distance tried to test us: Pune–Satara… yet the bond only grew deeper.
Then I flew to Vizag in April just to see him — that one hug said everything I couldn’t put into words.
His new posting in Lonavala brought him closer geographically, but his Navy life taught me patience, pride, and strength. ⚓
Our Gwalior–Jodhpur trip became a mix of laughter, fights, and memories we’ll cherish forever.
“Jevha tu mala pahilla, tevha life thambli… ani navi suruvat jhali.” 💙
