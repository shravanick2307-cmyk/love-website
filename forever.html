        I choose you.  
        Today, tomorrow and every version of forever.  
        You are my peace, my silly love, my favorite everything.  

        Shubh… being with you has changed everything for me. You’ve brought softness into my chaos, warmth into my routines, and meaning into my every tomorrow.
We argue, we misunderstand, we overthink… yet somehow, we always choose to stay. That’s what love truly is.
I chose you in Vizag, I chose you during your Lonavala days, I chose you on every trip, in every fight, in every silent moment.
And today also — I choose you.
I love your profession, your passion, your discipline, and your heart. ⚓💙
So…
Will you be mine forever?
Hold my hand in every season — in joy, in distance, in storms, in celebrations.
“Ayushya bhar, haath sodu nakos. Mazya sobat chal. Forever.” 💍❤
