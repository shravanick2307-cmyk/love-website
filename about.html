      <h3>Our Journey</h3>
      <p>
        The story of us isn’t perfect, but it’s real, warm, and ours. We laugh a lot, fight a lot, misunderstand each other sometimes — yet at the end of every storm, we choose each other again. 💞
My trip to Vizag in April wasn’t just travel; it was my heart running to the person it loves. The moment I saw him, everything felt peaceful again.
Then came his posting in Lonavala — closer to me, yet his Navy duty still pulls him far. ⚓💙
We even travelled to Gwalior and Jodhpur together — new cities, new photos, new memories… a little chaos, a little romance.
We’re messy, funny, dramatic, caring — but deeply in love.
“Aplya doghancha rasta kadhi kadhi vakda hoto, pan antala ekmekanchyach kade jato.” ❤✨
