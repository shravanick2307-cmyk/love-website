        More than the stars love the night sky,  
        More than flowers love the spring...  
        More than poems love soft hearts —  
        I love YOU. 
🌹✨

        My love for him isn’t loud — it’s deep, peaceful, strong. He carries the calm of the ocean and the discipline of the Navy, and I admire him endlessly. ⚓💙
Yes, we fight. Yes, we misunderstand each other. But our hearts always find their way back — because we belong.
His uniform makes me proud, but his softness makes me fall in love every day.

🌹✨

You are my calm after every storm,
My safe place, my heart’s warm.
In your uniform, you shine so bright,
You’re my day, you’re my night.

“Man kasa bhulata tujhyavar,
Dur astanna pan hoto adhik pyar.”*
With every fight and every test,
Shubhankar, with you — I love you best. 💙✨
